# Anacleto Digital Library

The Anacleto Digital Library was the product of the Italian-Hungarian company Tesuji Srl. It was created in 2004, and has some installations all over the world. We have worked together with the World Public Library project, Project Gutenberg, Arcanum Adatbázis Kft., Országos Széchényi Könyvtár. The Tesuji team consisted of Róbert Király, Péter Király (software development), Anna Tótfalusi, Gábor Somogyi (business development).

Anacleto consists of two projects:

* a core library and the administrating web interface (this project)
* a web user interface (a custom project, you can find an example at http://github.com/pkiraly/anacleto-web)

Technically Anacleto is based on different Open Source Java technologies:

* Apache Struts 1.0 web framework
* Apache Lucene text indexing and searching library
* Apache Tomcat servlet container
