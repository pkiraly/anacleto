/**
 * This servlet does nothing. It is provided as a convenience for containers that do not allow the use of
 * j_security_check as the login form submit pattern. An alternate pattern, such as /login can be used and
 * mapped to this servlet. With that configuration, this servlet will never be executed becuase the filter
 * will intercept all requests to /login and never pass them down the chain to this servlet.
